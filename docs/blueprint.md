# **App Name**: VectorView

## Core Features:

- Vector Input and Visualization: Input custom vectors (v1, v2, v3) via text boxes, and visualize them in 3D using Three.js. Vectors are defined by x, y, and z components.
- Vector Sum and Difference: Toggle display of vector sum (v1 + v2) and difference (v1 - v2) as new vectors in distinct colors (purple and turquoise).
- Dot Product Display: Display the scalar dot product of two vectors and its visual interpretation, such as the projection of one vector onto another.
- Cross Product Visualization: Show the cross product (v1 x v2) as a new vector (green) that is perpendicular to both input vectors.
- Challenge Generation: Randomly generate challenges where users adjust vectors to match a target result. An AI tool assesses correctness by comparing resultant vector properties (magnitude, direction) against the target.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Blue (#29ABE2) to represent mathematical precision.
- Background color: Light grey (#F5F5F5) to reduce eye strain.
- Accent: Green (#90EE90) for interactive elements and challenge success.
- Clean, sans-serif typography to ensure readability of vector components and labels.
- Simple, geometric icons to represent vector operations and interactive functions.
- Split-screen layout with vector input on one side and 3D visualization on the other.
