# 🎯 3D Vector Playground – Interactive Vector Simulator

Welcome to the **3D Vector Playground**, an interactive educational tool built to help students and curious minds visualize and understand vector operations in 3D space.

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this experiment is to create a **visual and interactive simulator** for vector mathematics using **web technologies** and **Firebase**, making abstract math and physics concepts more tangible and intuitive.

This project is especially useful for:
- High school and university students studying linear algebra or physics.
- Teachers looking for an engaging way to demonstrate vector operations.
- Anyone curious about how vectors behave in 3D space.

## 🚀 Features (In Progress)

- Input and visualize multiple 3D vectors.
- Show vector addition, subtraction, dot product (scalar), and cross product (vector).
- Display angles between vectors and projections.
- Tag vectors with names like "force", "velocity", etc.
- Animate vector movement and visualize changes over time.
- Save and share simulations using **Firebase**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: JavaScript / React / Three.js
- **Backend & Storage**: Firebase (Firestore, Authentication)

## 📚 Educational Purpose

I was trying to reach an argument of Mathematics for machine learning so I decided to construct with firebase this.
